This is to learn how to create branch, pull requests and merging on github
Hey world, my name is Adejuwon Adeyeye. I'm learning how to use github. Its kinda fun though, actually thought it'd be more hard. Like writing some sought of codes and maybe some console.log bs. Lol. My point is I wanna learn as much as I can here.
